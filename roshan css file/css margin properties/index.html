        <p>God of War is an action-adventure game franchise created by David Jaffe and developed by Sony's Santa Monica
            Studio. It began in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 (PS2) video game console and has become a flagship series for
            PlayStation, consisting of nine installments across multiple platforms. Based on ancient mythologies, the
            series' plot follows Kratos, a Spartan warrior who becomes the God of War and comes into conflict with
            various mythological pantheons. The earlier games in the series are based on Greek mythology and see Kratos
            follow a path of vengeance against the Olympian gods; the later games are based on Norse mythology and see
            Kratos go on a path of redemption while also introducing his son Atreus as a secondary protagonist.

            Santa Monica Studio has developed all main entries, while Ready at Dawn and Javaground/Sony Online
            Entertainment-Los Angeles (SOE-LA) developed the three side games. Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) has
            published all games except the mobile phone installment, which was published by Sony Pictures Digital. The
            first seven games make up the Greek era of the franchise. God of War (2005), God of War II (2007) and God of
            War III (2010) comprise its main trilogy; the first two were released on the PS2 with the third on the
            PlayStation 3 (PS3). A prequel, Ascension (2013), was also released for the PS3. Other games include Chains
            of Olympus (2008) and Ghost of Sparta (2010) for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) and Betrayal (2007) for
            mobile phones that supported the Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME). The Norse era began with the 2018
            game God of War, which was released for the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and later Windows in January 2022. It was
            accompanied by a short prequel, A Call from the Wilds (2018), a text-based game through Facebook Messenger.
            A sequel, Ragnarök, was released in November 2022 for the PS4 and PlayStation 5 (PS5) and concluded the
            Norse era, which received an epilogue in the form of an expansion pack titled Valhalla in December 2023; a
            Windows port of Ragnarök is scheduled for September 2024.

            Games in the series have been praised as some of the best action games of all time. The series has received
            numerous awards, including several Game of the Year recognitions for the 2005 and 2018 installments. Some
            games have also been remastered for newer PlayStation platforms. As of November 2023, the franchise has sold
            an estimated 66+ million games worldwide, and is PlayStation's most profitable first-party brand. Strong
            sales and support of the series led to the franchise's expansion into other media, such as three comic book
            series and three novels. A film adaptation of the original installment had been in development but was
            ultimately canceled; however, a television series adaptation of the Norse era is in development for Amazon
            Prime Video. Merchandise includes artwork, clothing, toys, and prop replicas, as well as the games'
            soundtracks, including a heavy metal album, Blood & Metal (2010), featuring original music by various bands
            who were inspired by the series.
