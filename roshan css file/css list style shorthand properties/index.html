        <li>Son Goku[nb 20] is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series created by
            Akira Toriyama. He is based on Sun Wukong (known as Son Goku in Japan and Monkey King in the West), a main
            character of the classic 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West, combined with influences from the
            Hong Kong action cinema of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. Goku made his debut in the first Dragon Ball chapter,
            Bulma and Son Goku,[nb 21][nb 22] originally published in Japan's Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine on December 3,
            1984.[2] Goku is introduced as an eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses
            superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the seven wish-granting Dragon Balls.
            Along the way, he finds new friends who follow him on his journey to become stronger. As Goku grows up, he
            becomes the Earth's mightiest warrior and battles a wide variety of villains with the help of his friends
            and family, while also gaining new allies in the process.</li>

        <li>Born under the name Kakarot,[nb 23][nb 24] as a member of the Saiyan race on Planet Vegeta, he is sent to
            Earth as an infant prior to his homeworld's destruction at the hands of Frieza (ordered by Beerus).[3] Upon
            his arrival on Earth, the infant is discovered by Son Gohan, who becomes the adoptive grandfather of the boy
            and gives him the name Goku. The boy is initially full of violence and aggression due to his Saiyan nature,
            until an accidental head injury turns him into a cheerful, carefree person. Grandpa Gohan's kindness and
            teachings help to further influence Goku, who later on names his first son Gohan in honor of him</li>
